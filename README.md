# Player Movement & Combat System (Unreal Engine 5.6)

A simple **player movement and combat system** built in **Unreal Engine 5.6** using both **C++** and **Blueprints**.  
This project was created to strengthen my understanding of Unreal’s **gameplay framework**, **animation system**, and **network replication**.

## 🎮 Features

### Player Movement
- Implemented **walking** and **crouching** using the **Character Movement Component** and **Enhanced Input System**.  
- Integrated both **C++ logic** and **Blueprint scripting** for modularity and flexibility.

### Melee Combat
- Developed a **basic 3-hit combo attack system** using **Play Montage** and **AnimMontage Notify Events**.  
- Inspired by Unreal Engine’s official **Game Animation Sample** project.  
- Includes simple **combo state logic** for smooth transitions between attacks.

### Multiplayer (Work in Progress)
- Added a **basic Multicast RPC setup** to replicate player actions and animations across clients.  
- Serves as the foundation for **future multiplayer scalability**.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Fundamentals of **animation blueprints**, **replication**, and **server-client synchronization**.  
- How Unreal handles **input mapping**, **animation montages**, and **networked gameplay logic**.  
- The importance of **state management** and **replication** for responsive multiplayer mechanics.

---

## 🔧 Next Steps
- Refine **combo transitions** and **animation timing**.  
- Experiment with **network prediction** for smoother multiplayer responsiveness.  
- Expand combat logic to include **hit detection** and **damage systems**.
